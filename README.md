# crocodiles-clocks

## My name is Andrey Davydov and here is my project report for Skoltech summer internship in Samsung. The project is devoted to the research based on the dataset with images of clocks and crocodiles. 

The project consists of three parts: 
  - binary **classification** of images (1), 
  - **extraction** of the images that are debateable, which label must be assigned to (2),
  - **generation** of new images that would hardly correspond to one of two classes.

### 0. Preprocessing

This project is devoted to image binary classfication and image generation on a pretty simple dataset of Crocodiles and Clocks.
